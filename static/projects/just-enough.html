            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Just Enough is a web application that allows users to learn the basics of various languages.
                Currently, there are four languages available to choose from, and there are several ways to
                learn and memorize important phrases from these languages.
            </p>
            <p>Just Enough was created by myself and a few other students as our 
                final project in my Software Engineering course, and I 
                continued to develop it in further classes and in my free time.
            </p>
            <p>It was created under the three-tier architecture model, and it features a client 
                made with Bootstrap and pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, a server built on Node.js, 
                and a NoSQL MongoDB database.
            </p>
            <p>I played a significant role in developing each of the three tiers as well as most 
                of the functionality seen in the current release.</p>
