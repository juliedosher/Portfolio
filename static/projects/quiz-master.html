            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>QuizMaster allows users to create quizzes for studying purposes or take quizzes that other 
                users have created.</p>
            <p>This program initially created by three students in their Computer Science 
                Capstone course the semester previous to my Capstone course. My Capstone team then inherited 
                this project with the goal of enhancing it and expanding its features.
            </p>
            <p>The project we inherited was elegant but simple. At the time, there were only 4 default quizzes 
                user could take, and these quizzes had the same 20 questions each time. There was also no way 
                for them to create their own quizzes. My primary responsibilites in this project were adding variability
                to the default quizzes, adding sub-categories to those default quizzes so users could focus on the topics
                they prefer, and creating a way for users to search and filter through the user-made quizzes.
            </p>
            <p>QuizMaster is built on React.js and Google Firebase.</p>
